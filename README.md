# Understanding the Impacts of AI

This is a collection of resources that I've found useful to:
* Understand the impacts of AI to society and to labour.
* Form my own opinions about AI use.
* Understand how to affect change in shaping the future of AI,
  particularly as a law maker or member of a labour union.


## Where to start?

* [How should regulators think about "AI"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK0md9tQ1KY):
  This 5 minute youtube video, presented by a professor of linguistics
  at the University of Washington,
  provides a very objective description of what AI is,
  and how to think about it in terms of its use in the workplace
  and its impacts to the labour market.


## Impacts From Use In HR Processes

* [Help Wanted: An Examination of Hiring Algorithms, Equity, and Bias](https://www.upturn.org/static/reports/2018/hiring-algorithms/files/Upturn%20--%20Help%20Wanted%20-%20An%20Exploration%20of%20Hiring%20Algorithms,%20Equity%20and%20Bias.pdf):
  An overview of of the various tools that are available for each stage of
  the hiring process and how they impact on equality and bias.
  This report also make a number of recommended actions
  for vendors, employers, law makers, and others
  to mitigate the identified negative impacts.
* [The Algorithm by Hilke Schellmann](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/65652a86-b8fa-4604-af98-406b465613a3):
  As you would expect from a book written by an assistant professor of journalism,
  this book gives very detailed research into a range of tools
  of a very wide range of HR processes.
  This book uses case studies to draw a picture of what these tools do and
  how they effect the individuals in the case study.


## Impacts to Developers

* [Accelerate State of DevOps 2024](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2024_final_dora_report.pdf) (pages 17-46):
  Note that this report was done by Google, who is set to gain from AI adoption.
  An insightful look into how AI is perceived by developers,
  AI's impact on software delivery performance,
  and its shortcomings.
* [Can Generative AI Improve Developer Productivity?](https://uplevelteam.com/hubfs/Content%20Assets/Can%20Generative%20AI%20Improve%20Developer%20Productivity.pdf):
  A short report (with little explanation or evidence)
  that shows a few statistics on Copilot's effect on developer output.
  It also gives some recommendations to developers and team leads
  on how to prevent Copilot from reducing productivity.
* [AI Copilot Code Quality](https://gitclear-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/AI-Copilot-Code-Quality-2025.pdf):
  A detailed look at how code quality has changed as AI adoption has increased.
  It makes no attempt to correlate the data with AI usage,
  but it shows how patterns in code being written are changing
  and correlates this with other AI focused research.


## Impacts To the Labour Market

* [The Future of Work](https://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Future%20of%20Work%20Report%20(FINAL).pdf) (Chapter 3, Sections 2, and 3):

  This report is aimed at law makers,
  and aims to educate those who are not familiar with AI
  about how it can be used in the workplace,
  and its impacts on labour.

  protect employees.
* [Future Unscripted: The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Entertainment Industry Jobs](https://www.animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Future-Unscripted-The-Impact-of-Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Entertainment-Industry-Jobs-pages-1.pdf):
  Commissioned by the Animation Guild.

  who in the VFX industry is being affected,
  and how.


## Affecting Change

* [Accelerating Progress Toward Trustworthy AI](https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/documents/Mozilla_Accelerating_Progress_Toward_Trustworthy_AI_v3.pdf):
  Written by Mozilla, who are self-described "AI realists",
  this report describes how AI is evolving,
  the risks of letting the current state of who is evolving AI and how to continue,
  and how the shape of the industry can be changed to make AI more
  trustworthy for society as a whole.
  This report was foundational in setting my mindset towards AI.
